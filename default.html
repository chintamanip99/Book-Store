    <pre>Game theory is the study of how 
         we make a decision when the
         outcome 
         of our moves depends on the 
         decisions 
         of someone else. 
         Economists Ivan and Tuvana 
         Pastine
         explain why, 
         in these situations, we sometimes 
         cooperate, 
         sometimes clash, and sometimes 
         act in
         a way that seems completely random.
